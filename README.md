# weekend-movie-sagas

## Description

Duration: 3 day sprint

I was tasked with creating, and linking, movie details to an existing movie list. Additional React components needed to be created. Redux-Sagas and Postgres/Postico were utilized. 

## Installation

1. Create a database named "saga_movies_weekend",
2. The queries in the data.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an npm install
4. Run npm run server in your terminal
5. Run npm run client in your terminal
6. The npm run client command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Usage
1. Begin at the home page where the movie list appears. 
2. Click any movie to view details including genres, description, and poster. 
3. To return to list, click the Back To List button located under the movie description. 


## Built With
